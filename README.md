# Clima Flutter App
A Flutter App that helps you find the exact weather in any city in the world or in your current city. The app also suggest to carry an umbrella or a jacket with you according to weather. The app is available for both apple and android device(not on stores yet).

## Challenge & Proposed Solution
Living in a coastal town of Atlantic Canada, weather always changes. Sometimes it starts snowing or raining all of a sudden even if the weather showed no chances of rain last day. Many people find this dissapointing and it is always an argument, if you have to or not have to carry a jacket/umbrella on your day out!

To tackle with this problem of ever changing weather, I developed an application that can actually suggest if you need an umbrella or jacket on your way out. This is very helpful as the real time weather data is extracted from Open Weather API using JSON.

## Tools Used
To develop this application, 
Software Development Kit: Flutter
Programming Languages: Dart, Java, JSON
IDEs : Android Studio, VS Code
UI: Sketch

The first page is the main page of the application, that shows the weather report for the current hour in your current city. The Second page helps in searching for different cities and finding the weather report. To use this application, Internet connection and location data is needed.

## Development
[Myself](https://github.com/Apurv-T) worked to develop the iOS and Android application using Flutter, Dart, Android Studio and Java.

## Result

## Future Plans
Figuring out the strong UI features and animations that Flutter offers, I would like to further improve the UI of the app. I would also like to add more features like weather for the week, storm watch and environment alerts. After completing these features, I would like to put the application on both the app store and play store.

## Thank you.
